# HS-WD200+ Idle Light Colors

This HS3 plugin allows you to set a custom normal mode color for when your HS-WD200+ dimmers are turned off.
This is useful if you set your dimmers to leave the bottom LED on when the load is off, allowing you to tell
at a glance if the load is on or not. Also, I think it provides for a better atmosphere.

Additionally, this allows you to tell quickly at a glance if HS3 is getting instant status updates for your
dimmer, as it won't change colors when turned on if HS3 isn't getting status updates properly.

This might be on the HS3 plugin updater someday. Until then, you'll need to install it manually.

Also, I haven't bothered to make a page where you can configure the colors, yet. So for now it'll be blue
when off and white when on for all detected dimmers.
