# HS-WD200+ Idle Light Colors

This HS3 plugin allows you to set a custom normal mode color for when your HS-WD200+ dimmers are turned off.
This is useful if you set your dimmers to leave the bottom LED on when the load is off, allowing you to tell
at a glance if the load is on or not. Also, I think it just looks better.

As a nice bonus, this allows you to tell quickly at a glance if HS3 is getting instant status updates for your
dimmer, as it won't change colors when turned on if HS3 isn't getting status updates properly.

The plugin's color settings default to white when the dimmer is on, and blue when it's off. For the best results,
you should configure each of your dimmers to have the bottom LED "off when load is on". This setting is a misnomer,
as the bottom LED will still be on when the load is on, but it will also be on when the load is off.
